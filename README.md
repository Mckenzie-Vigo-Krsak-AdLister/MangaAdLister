## Post Listing Flow

When the user gets to the Manga Listings page, there will be user input options available to them on the page.
One of these options will be to post their own listings. Since the listings page will be available to the public
the first thing we do is check if the user has already been authenticated. If so, we redirect them to the page where
they can fill out the details of their listing. If not, we redirect them to the login page where they can either
fill in their auth details
